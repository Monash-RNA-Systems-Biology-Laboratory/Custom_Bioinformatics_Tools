Listed here are two apps programmed for use in the Beilharz Lab (RNASystems).
Both apps aim to visualise and aid biologists in the understanding and interpretation of results coming out of the wet-lab.

Hmaps - 
A tool for producing dynamically generated heatmaps for visualisation of gene expression.

NormVis-
A tool for visualising and observing the effect of normalisation on gene expression of single genes.

Both tools use the same method of adding datasets, and NormVis requires an extra confg.csv file to make it read the data correctly.
Apps and documentation can be found hosted on the lab server.
