Listed here are two apps programmed for use in the Beilharz Lab (RNASystems Biology).
Both apps aim to visualise and aid biologists in the understanding and interpretation of results coming out of the wet-lab.

Hmaps - 
A tool for producing dynamically generated heatmaps for visualisation of gene expression.

NormVis-
A tool for visualising and observing the effect of normalisation on gene expression of single genes.

Both tools use the same method of adding datasets, and NormVis requires an extra confg.csv file to make it read the data correctly.
Data is taken from Tail-Tools output. Information about the Tail-Tools pipeline can be found on:
https://github.com/Victorian-Bioinformatics-Consortium/tail-tools

The Hmaps app borrows heavily from the Nesoni library for producing it's heatmaps. More information about Nesoni can be found on:

Additional documentation can be found hosted on the lab server or in the apps directory
